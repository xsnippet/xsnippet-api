# XSnippet API

XSnippet is a simple web-service for sharing code snippets on the Internet.
Years ago it was started as educational project, and nothing changed since
then. That's why the fifth reincarnation is written in Rust using Rocket.

XSnippet API, however, implements only RESTful API, nothing more. Web UI
is not a part of that project anymore.
