[server]

; IP ADDRESS TO LISTEN ON
;
; By default, only localhost interface is used for listening. That's
; why no requests from outer world will be handled. If you want to
; accept any incoming request on any interface, please change that
; value to '0.0.0.0'.
host = 127.0.0.1

; PORT TO LISTEN ON
;
; In production you probably will choose a default HTTP port - '80'.
; If you want to pick any random free port, just pass '0'.
port = 8000


; ACCESS LOG FORMAT
;
; Note, that you have to use double % signs for escaping to work.
;
; %t  - datetime of the request
; %a  - remote address
; %r  - request status line
; %s  - response status code
; %b  - response size (bytes)
; %Tf - request time (seconds)
;
; When deployed behind a reverse proxy, consider using the value of
; headers like X-Real-IP or X-Forwarded-For instead of %a
access_log_format = %%t %%a "%%r" %%s %%b %%{User-Agent}i" %%Tf


[database]

; DATABASE CONNECTION URI
;
; Supported backends: MongoDB only
connection = mongodb://localhost:27017/xsnippet


[snippet]

; LIST OF ALLOWED SYNTAXES
;
; Set constraint on 'snippet.syntax' property. Each syntax should come
; on separate line. E.g:
;
;    syntaxes =
;        cpp
;        python
;        javascript
;
; By default, constraint is not defined so any syntax is accepted.


[auth]

; SECRET KEY TO BE USED FOR VALIDATION OF SIGNED TOKENS
;
; If not set, it will be generated automatically for this run of application.
; Set the value explicitly, so that it's preserved between runs.
