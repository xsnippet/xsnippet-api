XSnippet API
============

|travis-ci| |coveralls|

XSnippet is a simple web-service for sharing code snippets on the Internet.
Years ago it was started as educational project, and nothing changed since
then. That's why the fourth reincarnation is written in Python using
``asyncio``.

XSnippet API, however, implements only RESTful API, nothing more. Web UI
is not a part of that project anymore.
